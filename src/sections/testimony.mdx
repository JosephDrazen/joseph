Joseph is incredibly driven and constantly seeks out ways to improve processes and solve problems. When he joined the Shopify Plus team we were having challenges with internal prospecting, so he set out to find a solution. In just a few short months, he took the initiative to work with both our Data and Solutions Engineering teams to spearhead a project that pulled comprehensive reports which drastically cut down our prospecting time. Not only did his efforts save our entire sales team hours of time, but it also surfaced an untapped market that ended up increasing the teamâ€™s MCV contributions. Every goal or expectation put in front of Joseph was reliably achieved and exceeded, making him an invaluable asset to the team.

Have you ever wanted to ask a co-worker how old they are? Sure, it's not really any of your business, but every once in a while you'll meet someone who looks young and seems to be starting their career, but acts with a maturity level, intelligence, and set of skills that makes you stop and wonder: Hey, maybe they're actually older than they look...?  I had that impression with Joseph. As an intern, I had a pretty good idea of his general age, but as I worked with him I realized his actual chronological age didn't matter. What mattered was his productivity and teamwork, which was on par with co-workers who have already been with the company for many months, if not years. His working style is smart and effective, and it didn't take long for me to stop thinking of him as an "intern" and instead consider him "an awesome and efficient co-worker."   And to add icing to the cake, Joseph is a lot of fun to be around. He's got a great sense of humour and a sharp wit, which led to some great conversations. I really enjoyed my time working with Joseph, and although I'm excited about his future career, I was sad to see him go

I had the pleasure of working with Joseph on a major lead-generation-and-automation project at Shopify Plus.   He's an amazing go-getter; being both bright, enthusiastic, and talented.   His business acumen and combined understanding of ecommerce & marketing proved invaluable in helping us deliver an impactful project in which we identified thousands of leads- which had a colossal impact on his team's quarterly results.  In the face of his talent and abilities, I would say that the one thing that Joseph 'lacks' is arrogance. He's easy to work with. Kind. Emotionally intelligent, a great listener and a good people person.  I thus offer my hearty recommendation, both for (hopefully?) his return to Shopify once he finishes school, or to whomever else is lucky enough scoop him up.</TestimonyCard>
