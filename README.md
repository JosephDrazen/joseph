# Joseph's Portfolio Website

## The purpose? 

This repo contains an ongoing personal project to display my work, code, and ideas in a minimalistic and simple web design. 

After spending eight months studying JS and React, I wanted to create a replacement for a basic portfolio I had put together with CSS and HTML during the first year of my computer science degree. 

I used modern frameworks like React to achieve a fluid and fast website that can fashionably illustrate my work and awards.

* Currently my site only supports desktop, tablets, and laptops. Working on a mobile friendly version which will be released in the coming weeks! 

## Frameworks / Tech stack
- React
- Material UI 
- Typescript
- Gatsby 

Why did I choose these technologies? 

Since I'm still in school and exploring many avenues to learn, I know I will be adding to my portfolio quite often. 

I wanted to make a fast website that was modular by design to make it easier for me to update and add to it whenever needed. 

React allowed me to build a fast website within a short amount of time, while Material UI gave me the tools to add user-friendly UI elements across my site quickly. Gatsby and MDx gave me the ability to turn markdown into well-structured content for my website and add to the site with ease. 

## Running locally? 

```git clone https://github.com/JosephDrazen/joseph```

```cd joseph```

```npm install```

```npm run```

Navigate to localhost. 

## Project Progress 

Since I constantly add new projects, awards, and content to my portfolio, it will never fully be 100% complete. However, the initial design and work are 80% complete. A few things I will be adding to this project are: 

- [ ] Mobile-friendly design (this is a work in progress but should be complete soon!) 
- [ ] Edits to the parallax effect on the main page
- [ ] Minor design optimizations  
- [ ] Archived versions of my portfolio

## Known Issues

The mobile version is buggy and is currently being worked on.
